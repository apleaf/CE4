The first problem I ran into was figuring out that I had to label the memory in the random access memory to be able to use it in the programming wizard. After I figured that out, the first and second problems were easy to figure out.  Teh first program simply read in values and output them.  The second program I ROR'd the input three times to double it and then subtracted four by adding a hexidecimal C, the equivalent of subrtacting 4.  The third program loaded in the input 3, output that value to output 0, stored that value, then subsequently subracted one and output the value( two times), and then loaded the stored value and subtracted one before running through the loop again. I met the target end for both A and B.  The third problem gave me some trouble, as it was working alright for the first iteration, but the second loop through was skipping numbers.  If i input 3, it was corrrectly output 3,2,1 the first time, but the next loop through it would go to 0, F, E. After some tinkering  I figured out that I needed to store the value I was outputting to the first output each time through, and then reading it in for the next iteration of the loop.
